In contact-rich tasks, like dexterous manipulation, the hybrid nature of making and breaking contact creates challenges for model representation and control. For example, choosing and sequencing contact locations for in-hand manipulation, where there are thousands of potential hybrid modes, is not generally tractable. In this paper, we are inspired by the observation that far fewer modes are actually necessary to accomplish many tasks. Building on our prior work learning hybrid models, represented as linear complementarity systems,
we find a reduced-order hybrid model requiring only a limited number of task-relevant modes. This simplified representation, in combination with model predictive control, enables real-time control yet is sufficient for achieving high performance. We demonstrate the proposed method first on synthetic hybrid systems, reducing the mode count by multiple orders of magnitude while achieving task performance loss of less than 5%. We also apply the proposed method to a three-fingered robotic hand manipulating a previously unknown object. With no prior knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art closed-loop performance in less than five minutes of online learning.</p>
