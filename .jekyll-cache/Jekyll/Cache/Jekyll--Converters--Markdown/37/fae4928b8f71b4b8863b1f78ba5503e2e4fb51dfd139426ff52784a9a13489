In contact-rich tasks, like dexterous manipulation, the hybrid nature of
making and breaking contact creates challenges for model representation and
control. For example, choosing and sequencing contact locations for in-hand
manipulation, where there are thousands of potential hybrid modes, is not
generally tractable. In this paper, we are inspired by the observation that far
fewer modes are actually necessary to accomplish many tasks. Building on our
prior work learning hybrid models, represented as linear complementarity
systems, we find a reduced-order hybrid model requiring only a limited number
of task-relevant modes. This simplified representation, in combination with
model predictive control, enables real-time control yet is sufficient for
achieving high performance. We demonstrate the proposed method first on
synthetic hybrid systems, reducing the mode count by multiple orders of
magnitude while achieving task performance loss of less than 5%. We also apply
the proposed method to a three-fingered robotic hand manipulating a previously
unknown object. With no prior knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art
closed-loop performance in less than five minutes of online learning.

This paper proposes a novel approach that enables a robot to learn an objective function incrementally from human directional corrections. Existing methods learn from human magnitude corrections; since a human needs to carefully choose the magnitude of each correction, those methods can easily lead to over-corrections and learning inefficiency. The proposed method only requires human directional corrections -- corrections that only indicate the direction of an input change without indicating its magnitude. We only assume that each correction, regardless of its magnitude, points in a direction that improves the robot's current motion relative to an unknown objective function. The allowable corrections satisfying this assumption account for half of the input space, as opposed to the magnitude corrections which have to lie in a shrinking level set. For each directional correction, the proposed method updates the estimate of the objective function based on a cutting plane method, which has a geometric interpretation. We have established theoretical results to show the convergence of the learning process. The proposed method has been tested in numerical examples, a user study on two human-robot games, and a real-world quadrotor experiment. The results confirm the convergence of the proposed method and further show that the method is significantly more effective (higher success rate), efficient/effortless (less human corrections needed), and potentially more accessible (fewer early wasted trials) than the state-of-the-art robot learning frameworks.

This paper develops the method of Continuous Pontryagin Differentiable Programming (Continuous PDP), which enables a robot to learn an objective function from a few sparsely demonstrated keyframes. The keyframes, labeled with some time stamps, are the desired task-space outputs, which a robot is expected to follow sequentially. The time stamps of the keyframes can be different from the time of the robot's actual execution. The method jointly finds an objective function and a time-warping function such that the robot's resulting trajectory sequentially follows the keyframes with minimal discrepancy loss. The Continuous PDP minimizes the discrepancy loss using projected gradient descent, by efficiently solving the gradient of the robot trajectory with respect to the unknown parameters. The method is first evaluated on a simulated robot arm and then applied to a 6-DoF quadrotor to learn an objective function for motion planning in unmodeled environments. The results show the efficiency of the method, its ability to handle time misalignment between keyframes and robot execution, and the generalization of objective learning into unseen motion conditions.

We propose a Safe Pontryagin Differentiable Programming (Safe PDP) methodology, which establishes a theoretical and algorithmic framework to solve a broad class of safety-critical learning and control tasks -- problems that require the guarantee of safety constraint satisfaction at any stage of the learning and control progress. In the spirit of interior-point methods, Safe PDP handles different types of system constraints on states and inputs by incorporating them into the cost or loss through barrier functions. We prove three fundamentals of the proposed Safe PDP: first, both the solution and its gradient in the backward pass can be approximated by solving their more efficient unconstrained counterparts; second, the approximation for both the solution and its gradient can be controlled for arbitrary accuracy by a barrier parameter; and third, importantly, all intermediate results throughout the approximation and optimization strictly respect the constraints, thus guaranteeing safety throughout the entire learning and control process. We demonstrate the capabilities of Safe PDP in solving various safety-critical tasks, including safe policy optimization, safe motion planning, and learning MPCs from demonstrations, on different challenging systems such as 6-DoF maneuvering quadrotor and 6-DoF rocket powered landing.
